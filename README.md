A shipping plugin for WooCommerce that extends the Local pickup method by adding multiple pickup locations.

== Description ==

The built-in WooCommerce Local Pickup shipping method allows your customers pick up their purchased products personally, in your store. Local Pickup Extended extends this functionality by adding multiple pickup locations for your customers to choose from during checkout. The selected pickup location is displayed to your customer on Order details page (after purchase), in the Account â€“ View Order page (frontend) and in the order emails. 

Admins and/or shop managers can configure and offer a fee or discount for pickup in terms of fixed amount, fixed amount per product or percentage of cart total. If not defined the shipping method is free of charge.

1. Upload `mx-wc-local-pickup-extended` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the WooCommerce -> Settings -> Shipping -> Local Pickup Extended screen to configure the available options
